# DataScience-Projects
This repository containing a portfolio of data science projects I've done in the Master's program.

The program prepares me for a career as a Data science professional by helping me learn:
- Data Cleaning
- Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Wrangling
- Practical Statistics (i.e. applying inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, like analyzing A/B tests.)
- SQL for Data Analysis
- Data Visualization to draw meaningful conclusions
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing(NLP)

## Technical Skills utilized
* Python/R
* Data Analysis/Wrangling libraries (Numpy, Pandas)
* Data Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Bokeh, GGplot)
* statistical computations (Statsmodels, scikit-learn)
* Jupyter Notebooks
* IBM Watson Studio
* SQL
